Trying out LESS for CSS - wanted syntax highlighting in Notepad++, and found
this link: [How to enable syntax highlighting for LESS in 
Notepad++](http://thingsilearned2day.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/how-to-enable-syntax-highlighting-for-less-in-notepad/
"How to enable syntax highlighting for LESS in Notepad++"). However, ended up not
using LESS because I don't need all its functionalities.  Right now my styling 
is pretty simple; the only thing I'd probably want to use is the scoped styling,
but including LESS just for that seems overkill.

While styling the blog categories/tags/comments I also came across this
useful page about CSS shorthands: [CSS Shorthand 
Guide](http://www.dustindiaz.com/css-shorthand/ "CSS Shorthand Guide").
