BaconFriedRice-Redesign-May-2012
================================

Redesigning [BaconFriedRice.com](http://www.baconfriedrice.com "BaconFriedRice")
in May of 2012.  Attempting a very simple mobile-first responsive design.  Notes
about my progress and links to useful resources are in notes.md.

Learned a lot for this redesign from the following resources, although I did not
use them directly:

* [Responsive Web Design 
book](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design "Responsive Web
Design")
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/ "HTML5 Boilerplate")
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap")
