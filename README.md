BaconFriedRice-Redesign-May-2012
================================

Redesigning [BaconFriedRice.com](http://www.baconfriedrice.com "BaconFriedRice")
in May of 2012.  Attempting a very simple mobile-first responsive design.  Notes
about my progress and links to useful resources are in notes.md.

My approach is the following:

* Create a basic mobile-first responsive structure with no CSS3 or HTML5, other
than using media queries.  Since it is mobile-first, browsers not supporting
media queries will just show the mobile layout.
* Style it, again using no CSS3 or HTML5.  At this point, I have a passable site
that does not depend on browsers' CSS3, HTML5, or JavaScript abilities.
* Add more styling, allowing myself to use CSS3.  Browsers that support these
get a prettier site!
* Add any new HTML5 elements that might be useful.  Again, browsers that support
these get a better site.
* Allow myself to use JavaScript to add cool features and effects.  Since I am
doing this last just to add frosting, the site's basic functionality does not
rely on JavaScript, so people who don't enable JavaScript (who does that???)
can still use the site.

Learned a lot for this redesign from the following resources, although I did not
use them directly:

* [Responsive Web Design 
book](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design "Responsive Web
Design")
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/ "HTML5 Boilerplate")
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap")

These sites were extremely helpful as I was putting this together (more details
about these are in notes.md):
